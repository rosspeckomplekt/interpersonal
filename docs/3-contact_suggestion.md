## Contact Suggestion

In the case of any situation, `interpersonal` can suggest the best person by computing the vector of desired outcome for each situation and finding contacts who have personalities closest to the desired personality.

*Representation graph for the personalities of Mary’s contacts. `d` is the vector of desired outcome and `u` is the vector of Mary’s personality. The ideal contact in this situation is Bob, because his personality is closest to the vector desired personality, `c`.*

`interpersonal` can also recommend alliances based on the distance between people on the representation graph.

*`interpersonal` would recommend July to be allied with June and Lee because their personalities are the most similar.*

Example use cases for alliance recommendations are in multi-player online games when users need to quickly form teams for campaigns.
