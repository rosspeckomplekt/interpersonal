## The Leary Circumplex


`interpersonal` is a based on the Leary Circumplex[1], which in turn is a type of interpersonal circle. An interpersonal circle is a model of interpersonal interaction which plots every interacting person or every word describing a person on a two-dimensional graph. The Leary Circumplex uses such a graph with the axes represent the dominance and friendliness respectively of each person or word on the graph. `interpersonal` uses this graph to compute various results.
